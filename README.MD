# MABA 2222 Coronavirus Hackathon Challenge

This site contains resources for the MABA 2222 SY 2020 Hackathon Challenge. 


# Title: A Community Portal for tracking COVID-19 cases worldwide.
 
## Abstract

The World Health Organization and the Government of affected countries need close monitoring of virus cases per country to implement countermeasures to combat the increase of coronavirus infection.

We are creating an operations dashboard using various datasets worldwide with the help of the ArcGIS online tool to visualize and create an interactive live map that can be viewed and drilled down by users globally. A dashboard that can provide near real-time visibility of the rate of increase or decrease of infections per country will enable authorities a proactive effort to control the spread. 

The system should alert power-users for new cases in the country, increasing cases, and even declining cases of infection to measure the effectiveness of control.

## Objective

* The coronavirus outbreak has global attention due to its unpredictable nature and high infection rate. 
* The goal is to conceptualize a business analytics project tackling the Coronavirus
* Scenario: A solution to help decision makers address the Coronavirus

## Specific Project Objective

Build a tracking tool for the stakeholders to have an understanding of the situation using the available data sources.

The project aims to answer the following questions:
How to quickly see the areas around the world that have increasing cases of coronavirus infections?
Which country needs immediate attention because of the constant and significant increase in cases of infections?
What is the status of COVID-19 infections in the country?
What is the current rate of infections in a specific location of interest?
What is the COVID-19 death rate in the country?
How effective are the government mitigation efforts to stop the infections and deaths?

## Sample Challenge Concepts

Some ideas to explore, and you can combine ideas for your project: 
* Data Visualization / Dashboard for Coronavirus - create a tool to help decision-makers manage information
* Predictive Modeling / Forecasting of Coronavirus Epidemic - use various models and algorithms to predict the future spread of the disease (ideas: SEIR, time-series, regression models, VAR, etc.)
* Language Processing / Topic Modeling of News (e.g. detect fake news, understand sentiment, what topics resonate with the coronavirus)
* Flight path / Network modeling of Epidemic - correlate spread of the disease with flight patterns
